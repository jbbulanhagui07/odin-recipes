      The joy of eating food comes from many things. Sometimes you get it from
      great, irresistible flavor as a result of a beautiful set of seasonings.
      And other times, it is from the feeling of satisfaction and fullness,
      which after all, is the entire reason we eat. But one of the things that
      can truly make a dining experience memorable is the celebration that comes
      with our eating. That's why Pork Sisig is so appealing to many.
