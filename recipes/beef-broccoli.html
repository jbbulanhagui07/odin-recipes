    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Beef with Broccoli is an Asian beef main dish. As the name suggests, this
      dish is mainly comprised of beef and broccoli combined with different
      sauces for that delightful Asian flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple recipe is so easy to follow. I would suggest though that you
      use beef sirloin or tenderloin to ensure that your dish will come-out
      tender. If in case you don't have them around and opted for another less
      tender beef part, it would help if you slice the meat thinly and pound it
      with a meat pounder.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb beef <em>sliced into thin pieces</em></li>
      <li>2 cups broccoli <em>cut into florets</em></li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ginger <em>minced</em></li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic <em>minced</em></li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/2 to 3/4 cups water <em>optional</em></li>
      <li>1/4 cup cooking oil</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Marinade Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Knorr Liquid Seasoning</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Sesame oil <em>optional</em></li>
      <li>3 tablespoons cooking wine <em>optional</em></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon granulated white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine beef, oyster sauce, Knorr Liquid Seasoning, Sesame oil, cooking
        wine, and sugar in a bowl. Mix well. Marinate beef for 15 minutes. Add
        cornstarch and mix to blend with all the ingredients. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons cooking oil in a cooking pot. Saut√© ginger and
        garlic. Add broccoli before the garlic starts to brown. Stir-fry for 1
        to 2 minutes. Remove from the pot. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the remaining oil into the pot. Add marinated beef once the oil
        gets hot. Stir-fry until the beef browns. You can add water to tenderize
        the beef further. If water is added, let it boil and stir as it
        evaporates. Add salt and ground black pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the cooked broccoli into the pot with the beef. Stir-fry for 3
        minutes.
