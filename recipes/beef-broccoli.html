    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Beef with Broccoli is an Asian beef main dish. As the name suggests, this
      dish is mainly comprised of beef and broccoli combined with different
      sauces for that delightful Asian flavor.

    <p>
      This simple recipe is so easy to follow. I would suggest though that you
      use beef sirloin or tenderloin to ensure that your dish will come-out
      tender. If in case you don't have them around and opted for another less
      tender beef part, it would help if you slice the meat thinly and pound it
      with a meat pounder.
